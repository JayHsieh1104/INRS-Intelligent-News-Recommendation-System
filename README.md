# INRS-Intelligent-News-Recommendation-System

This project aims to improve user experience in online news reading.

Nowadays, an increasing number of newspaper readers migrate to online sources, where they can actively seek the information they need from various platforms. However, overwhelming information and news actually hinder people from staying well informed. This motivated me to build a news aggregator website that consolidates and organizes content from pre-selected reliable news sites as well as provides content-based article recommendations. 

With the news aggregator, users do not need to visit separate websites for the latest content. Instead, they can easily access updates all in one place and get relevant article recommendations after finishing an article. It efficiently reduces effort in seeking news and users can obtain a comprehensive understanding of the news from different media viewpoints.
