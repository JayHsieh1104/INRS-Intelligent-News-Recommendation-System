# INRS - Intelligent News Recommendation System

[Introduction Page](#https://jayhsieh1104.github.io/INRS-Intelligent-News-Recommendation-System/)

Nowadays, an increasing number of newspaper readers migrate to online sources, where users can actively seek information from various platforms. However, overwhelming information and news actually hinder people from staying well informed. This fact motivated us to build INRS, a news aggregator consolidating and organizing content from pre-selected reliable news sites.

With INRS, you no longer need to visit separate websites for the latest content. All you need to do now is choose the topic you’re interested in and then enjoy news from different sources along with relevant news recommendations provided by INRS. This project aims at reducing user effort in seeking news and presenting news from different media viewpoints.
